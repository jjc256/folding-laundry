# Phase 1: Cloth Simulation Implementation

## Overview
In Phase 1, we've successfully implemented a basic cloth simulation using Three.js. The simulation features a square cloth that can be held and dropped onto a table surface, showcasing realistic physics behavior.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Physics Components

1. **Particle System**
   - Created a particle-based cloth structure with a 30x30 grid
   - Each particle has position, previous position, and acceleration properties
   - Implemented basic Verlet integration for physics calculations

2. **Constraint Solver**
   - Implemented distance constraints between neighboring particles
   - Added structural constraints (horizontal and vertical connections)
   - Added shear constraints (diagonal connections) for improved cloth behavior
   - Implemented multi-iteration constraint solving for stability

3. **Collision Detection**
   - Added table surface collision detection
   - Implemented penetration resolution with proper response
   - Created balanced collision response with angular momentum preservation
   - Used multiple collision iterations for stable results

### Visualization

1. **3D Rendering**
   - Used Three.js for rendering the cloth in 3D
   - Implemented proper lighting with shadows
   - Created a table mesh with collision properties
   - Added camera controls for viewing the simulation from different angles

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Integrated stats module to track frame rates
   - Optimized simulation parameters for better stability

### Interaction

1. **Cloth Behavior**
   - Implemented initial cloth pinning at center point
   - Added timed release after 1 second hold
   - Created realistic draping effect with proper damping

2. **Physics Parameters**
   - Fine-tuned key parameters including:
     - DAMPING: 0.05
     - GRAVITY: 981 * 1.4
     - COLLISION_RESPONSE: 0.5
     - SUB_STEPS: 4
     - RELAXATION: 0.2

## Current Limitations

1. No user interaction with the cloth (no dragging or manipulation)
2. Limited to square cloth shape only
3. Basic material properties without texture
4. Single dropping behavior without ability to reset simulation

## Next Steps

1. Implement user interaction to manipulate the cloth
2. Add different cloth materials and textures
3. Create more complex starting configurations
4. Begin work on stereo vision system for Phase 2
