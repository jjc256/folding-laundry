# Folding Laundry Simulation Project

A physics-based simulation of cloth folding using Three.js, with the goal of developing algorithms for robotic laundry folding.

## Project Overview

This project simulates clothing physics and develops computer vision and robotic manipulation algorithms for automated laundry folding. The system progresses through several phases, from basic cloth simulation to stereo vision, computer vision algorithms, and robotic manipulation, with an end goal of completely automating the laundry-folding process from a pile of clothes to organized stacks.

## Current Status

### Completed: Phase 1 - Cloth Simulation
- Implemented particle-based cloth physics using Three.js
- Created realistic cloth behavior with proper constraints and collision detection
- Developed a table surface with physics interactions
- Fine-tuned simulation parameters for stable and visually appealing results

### In Progress: Phase 2 - Stereo Vision System
- Implementing dual camera setup to simulate robot vision
- Creating UI for viewing from different camera perspectives
- Building tools for image processing and analysis
